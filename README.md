Udacity ML Capstone - Santander Customer Transaction Prediction
===============================================================

This github repo contains my final project for Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree. It contains my final report and all the necessary code to reproduce my results. 

Given the fact that i didn't have ready access to GPU's needed to train some algorithms used in this project. I executed the entirety of the project in the Google Collab environment. It should trivial to use this in a local environment by removing the Google Collab specific component needed to download the Dataset from Kaggle. 


Setup Instructions Google Collab - Preferred approach
-------------

Pre-requisites : A gmail account to be able to use Google Colab and a Kaggle account api token to automatically download the training dataset. 

1. Open Google Colab - https://colab.research.google.com .
2. Login into your gmail if you didn't.
3. Select Open Notebookk 
4. Select the section Github
5. Type the following URL : https://github.com/nlauchande/shuri/
6. Select the notebook final_report final_report.ipynb
7. Click on Runtime->Run all 
8. You need to upload your kaggle API token on the first section of the notebook. Instructions on how to setup a Kaggle API token can be seen in here : https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api
