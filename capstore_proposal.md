## Proposal
Santander Customer Transaction Prediction (Kaggle Competition)

### Domain Background


### Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to predict which type of transactions belongs each observation of the dataset.

### Datasets and Inputs

The datasets are provided by Santander on Kaggle competition website.

_Input Data fields_

- id - the id of a training/test set
- var0..var199 - features presented on the dataset 

### Solution Statementft

The solution will be predictions of each feature of the dataset.

### Benchmark Model

My benchmark model will be a simple linear regression model with the existing variables.

### Evaluation Metrics

Prediction results are evaluated on the area under the ROC curve metric .

The approach will be based on taking the score of the competition as evaluation.

### Project Design

- Step 1 : Exploratory Data Analysis

- Step 2 : Build baseline/benchmark model 

- Step 3 : Setup automated model development pipeline ( identify suitable tool ) 

- Step 4 : Iterate on model development 

- Step 5 : Write final report and conclusions
